code : " function sum() {\n  return 1 + 1\n}"

During testing: 
Backend route (or api endpoint is getting triggered), but it fails to parse the incoming request body -> 400(bad request)

checking in postman, routing/json parsing(OK)
so, crash happening inside getReview() when it talks to Gemini, because the key the SDK sees is undefined/wrong..

Error ‚ùå
is in api call, (The Google Gemini API receives the request, but rejects the API key)

Place (    console.log("GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY in service:", process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY?.slice(0, 8));) from ai.service.js to ai.controller.js ( the ai.service.js) not console logging..
