code : " function sum() {\n  return 1 + 1\n}"

During testing: 
Backend route (or api endpoint is getting triggered), but it fails to parse the incoming request body -> 400(bad request)

checking in postman, routing/json parsing(OK)
so, crash happening inside getReview() when it talks to Gemini, because the key the SDK sees is undefined/wrong..

Error ❌
is in api call, (The Google Gemini API receives the request, but rejects the API key)

Place (    console.log("GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY in service:", process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY?.slice(0, 8));) from ai.service.js to ai.controller.js ( the ai.service.js) not console logging..

// backend handles all Gemini logic, so NO GEMINI API KEY NEEDED IN FRONTEND✅
// api key is getting rejected, have to debug ...

// so postman :500(The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.) = Internal server error

//updated some backend environment, postman working fine, -> 200(Request successful. The server has responded as required.)
✅ Backend is responding(gemini communication working)
✅ Frontend is making correct requests

// not debug FRONTEND(to show response)..
- setReview(response.data)
+ setReview(response.data.review)   // pass the string only
